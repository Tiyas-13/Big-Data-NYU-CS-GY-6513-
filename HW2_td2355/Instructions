Assignment 2: MongoDB and Flask

 

Objective: to demonstrate how we can create a simple yet usable data product using MongoDB and data from different data sources.

Steps:

Using the books.csv file: 
Clean date data rows (6/31 and 11/31)
Create MongoDB db and collection
Create/insert documents from file to db
Remember: some books have multiple authors. What’s the best way to handle this with JSON? Should we preprocess the data in Python? If so, how?
Consider: Given the data product we’re looking to make? Does it make sense to store the data in an author-centric fashion or book-centric? Or both? Remember that in document DBs, avoiding duplicate data isn’t as important as in a relational model…
Using OpenLibrary API…
All queries and searches from this point forward must be in MongoDB
Conduct a search in your MongoDB instance for the following 3 authors:
JK Rowling
Stephen King
Gabriel Garcia Marquez
Using each author name, conduct a search on https://openlibrary.org for the author’s JSON document:
To find author (example: https://openlibrary.org/search/authors.json?q=firstname%20lastname
In the resulting doc(s), find your author’s key
Use that key (for example: OL123456) to find their works and bio info: https://openlibrary.org/authors/OL123456.json
Add this information to their existing document(s) in your MongoDB database/collection.
Using Python Flask, create:
A simple home page with 3 links, one for each author’s bio page
a single, simple bio page for each author with biographical information as well as links to each of their books on Amazon (if Amazon ID exists)
Consider: do you need a hard-coded HTML file for each author, or can you leverage Flask and GET or POST requests?
